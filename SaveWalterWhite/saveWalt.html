    My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.
    I mean, super brainiac annoying. He knows the most random stuff. Like
    how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.
    And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it
    takes up about 9% more space. Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt
    into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level
    will go down. He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He
    doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.
    I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is. He likes to cook
    because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemical
    reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always explaining as he
    goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.
    He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.

    My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I
    found out he was going to die. That it was going to happen
    soon. That it was real. Then I thought about a lot of stuff.
    Things I hadn't thought about for a long time. I guess I kind
    of took him for granted or something. I mean, our parents are
    just always there. You expect them to always be bugging you
    to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or
    try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one
    day. And make you get up early on the weekend to have
    "family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me
    crazy. I don't feel that way now. Everything's different since
    Dad got his diagnosis. Since I realized that one day in the
    near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.
</p>
<p>

    It's been a really tough time in our family since my dad got cancer. Not
    that there's ever a good time for something as awful and as scary as that,
    but it was sure a bad time for us. My mom was pregnant with what she calls
    a surprise baby (who is now Holly and even though she's a newborn baby she's
    actually cute) and my dad had an extra job after school to try to help pay
    all the regular bills. And that was before he got his diagnosis. We don't
    have a lot of money but we were doing okay until all the medical bills. And
    my dad is pretty proud - okay, really proud - and doesn't want to take char-
    ity. That's why I'm doing this. Not because I want to make him mad or
    upset, but because I want him to have a fighting chance no matter what.

</p>

    One thing I don't understand is why saving someone's life costs more than a
    regular person can pay. And why some doctor's (usually the best ones) don't
    take insurance. I think that's wrong. I mean, one of the big reasons why
    my dad didn't want to get treatment at all in the first place was because he
    didn't want to leave us behind with a huge debt. That's the thing about my
    dad - he loves us more than anything. More than himself. But we want him
    around and we want him to try everything he can to stay with us as long as
    possible. This surgery is the one chance there is to save his life. And we
    can't afford it. And every day that goes by is one less day I'll have with
    him. And I don't want to tell my little sister about my dad. I want her to
    know him for herself.
